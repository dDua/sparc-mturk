                        This task involves creating questions and answers from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning.
                        The answer to the question can be words from the passage, dates, or numbers.  The most important point is that the
                        questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer.  We will make sure that the questions are
                        sufficiently complex by running a simple question answering system on your question; if the system gets the answer
                        right, the question is too easy.  The more you create challenging questions, the more you earn.

                    <p>
                        Below, we provide some example questions that involve different kinds of reasoning.  Try to use a variety of
                        reasoning types in the questions you come up with, and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates).

                        Austria-Hungary precipitated the <span class="ans_span1">Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909</span>
                        by <span class="ans_span8">officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina</span>, which it had
                        occupied since <span class="ans_span3">1878 </span>. This <span class="ans_span9">
                            angered the Kingdom of Serbia and
                            its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire
                        </span>. Russian political manoeuvring in the
                        region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to
                        be known as the "powder keg of Europe." In <span class="ans_span4">
                            1912 and 1913,
                            the First Balkan War
                        </span> was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire.
                        The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the
                        territorial holdings of <span class="ans_span6">Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece </span>. When <span class="ans_span2">
                            Bulgaria attacked Serbia
                            and Greece on 16 June 1913
                        </span>, it <span class="ans_span10">
                            lost most of Macedonia to Serbia
                            and Greece

                        </span> , further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these
                        Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

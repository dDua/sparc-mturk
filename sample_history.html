                        This task involves creating questions and answers from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning.
                        The answer to the question can be words from the passage, dates, or numbers.  The most important point is that the
                        questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer.  We will make sure that the questions are
                        sufficiently complex by running a simple question answering system on your question; if the system gets the answer
                        right, the question is too easy.  The more you create challenging questions, the more you earn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below, we provide some example questions that involve different kinds of reasoning.  Try to use a variety of
                        reasoning types in the questions you come up with, and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates).
                        A <b><i>span</i></b> is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage. You can directly copy-paste the text from the
                        passage into span box. If you find multiple spans, please use the '+/-' button to add/remove. A <b><i>number</i></b> type
                        answer can include a digit  specifying an actual value and an associated unit like year, yards and cms etc. If a question is
                        a <i>"how many"</i> type question (for eg., How many years did the war last?), the units will be disabled. A <b><i>date</i></b> type
                        answer can be used to specify a date with the help of a date selector.

                        Austria-Hungary precipitated the <span class="ans_span1">Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909</span>
                        by <span class="ans_span8">officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina</span>, which it had
                        occupied since <span class="ans_span3">1878 </span>. This <span class="ans_span9">
                            angered the Kingdom of Serbia and
                            its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire
                        </span>. Russian political manoeuvring in the
                        region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to
                        be known as the "powder keg of Europe." In <span class="ans_span4">
                            1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War
                        </span> was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire.
                        The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the
                        territorial holdings of <span class="ans_span6">Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece </span>. When <span class="ans_span2">
                            Bulgaria attacked Serbia
                            and Greece on 16 June 1913
                        </span>, it <span class="ans_span10">
                            lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece
                        </span>, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the <span class="ans_span5">
                            33-day Second Balkan War
                        </span> , further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these
                        Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

                <h4> <b>The Rules of the task are as follows : </b></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> Given a passage, you need to create questions that can be answered from the passage. </li>
                    <li>
                        You have five passages to pick from, and between these five passages, you must create at least 10 questions to
                        submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you create the question, you need to write its answer, either in the form of a date, a number, or spans
                        copied directly from the passage.
                    </li>
                    <li> There is an AI running in the background which will also try to answer the question.</li>
                    <li> You won't be able to submit the question if the AI gives the same reponse. </li>
                    <li>
                        You can go back and forth between the passages, and you can edit questions by clicking on them.  Once you have
                        finished all 10 questions, go to the last passage to submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some passages are easier to generate questions from than others, so if you have a hard time, move to a different passage.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Just as a reminder, here are some patterns that often give good questions.  Combining ideas
                    from several of these examples is even better. It's often good to use comparatives ("more", "longer", "farther") or superlatives ("most", "shortest") in questions. Here are some example question types for more help.

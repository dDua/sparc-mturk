                        This task involves creating questions and answers from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning.
                        The answer to the question can be words from the passage, dates, or numbers.  The most important point is that the
                        questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer.  We will make sure that the questions are
                        sufficiently complex by running a simple question answering system on your question; if the system gets the answer
                        right, the question is too easy.  The more challenging questions you create, the more you earn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below, we provide some example questions that involve different kinds of reasoning.  Try to use a variety of
                        reasoning types in the questions you come up with, and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates).
                        A <b><i>span</i></b> is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. You can directly copy-paste the text from the
                        passage or question into span box. If you find multiple spans, please use the '+/-' button to add/remove. Please restrict each span to five words.
                        You can either separate a span into multiple spans if the answer is a list. If you are unable to do so, please try writing a more specific question.
                        A <b><i>number</i></b> type answer can include a digit specifying an actual value. Number-type answer can only accept a <i>"How many ..."</i> type question.
                        So remember to phrase the corresponding question for any number-type answer correctly. For instance, <i>"How long was the touchdown pass?"</i> can
                        be phrased as <i>"How many yards was Flacco's touchdown pass?"</i>. Please <b>AVOID</b> creating questions which are either very vague
                        like <i>"Which is the home or away team?"</i> or do not require complex reasoning and just rely on parsing scores "9-6" without
                        any arithmetic operations on these scores.
                    </p>

                        Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Raiders, the Broncos flew
                        to The Meadowlands for a Week 13 duel with the New York Jets, considered one of the best teams in the
                        league, fresh off their victory over the undefeated Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Denver drew
                        first blood as safety Vernon Fox returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.  The Jets would respond
                        with RB Thomas Jones getting a 59-yard TD run.  The Broncos would answer with QB Jay Cutler completing
                        a 59-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal, along with kicker Matt Prater getting a 25-yard field goal.
                        In the second quarter, New York drew close as Jones got a 29-yard TD run.  The Broncos would reply with
                        rookie RB Peyton Hillis getting a 1-yard TD run, while Prater got a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter,
                        the Jets tried to rally as kicker Jay Feely nailed a 30-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Denver
                        pulled away as Cutler completed a 36-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley. The Broncos won the match with 34-17.

                <h2 id="Q1">Let's start writing some questions now!</h2>
                <h4> <b>The Rules of the task are as follows : </b></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> Given a passage, you need to create questions that can be answered from the passage. </li>
                    <li>
                        You have five passages to pick from, and between these five passages, you must create at least 12 questions to
                        submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you create the question, you need to write its answer, either in the form of a date, a number, or spans
                        copied directly from the passage.
                    </li>
                    <li> There is an AI running in the background which will also try to answer the question.</li>
                    <li> You won't be able to submit the question if the AI gives the same reponse. </li>
                    <li>
                        You can go back and forth between the passages, and you can edit questions by clicking on them.  Once you have
                        finished all 12 questions, go to the last passage to submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some passages are easier to generate questions from than others, so if you have a hard time, move to a different passage.
                    </li>
